            <p>The evaluation criteria are intended to support both teams and jury members in evaluating a pitch. Teams
                can use this tool to prepare their pitch. Jury members can use it in the preselection process and during
                final presentations, asking proper questions, and providing feedback to the teams. </p>

                            are. Check
                            if the customer segment is clearly defined and whether a break-even point can be
